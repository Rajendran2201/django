# Working with success messages

* If the form is considered as a valid one, we have to show the success message. In order to do this, add the following code snippet.

```python
if form.is_valid() :

	success_message = "Your form has been submitted!"
	
	return render(request, 'contact.html', {'form':form, 'success_message':success_message})
```

* Now, display the success message in the contact web page.
