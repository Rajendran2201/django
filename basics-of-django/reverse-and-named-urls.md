# Reverse and named URL's

In web development, particularly in frameworks like Django, **named URLs** and **URL reversing** are mechanisms to simplify and improve the maintainability of your project.

***

### What do they mean?

**1. Named URLs**

A named URL is a way to assign a unique identifier (name) to a specific URL pattern in your web application. This allows you to refer to the URL by its name instead of its hardcoded path.

* **Why Use Named URLs?**
  * Makes the codebase more maintainable: if the actual URL pattern changes, you donâ€™t need to update every reference to that URL.
  * Enhances readability and clarity in templates and views.

***

**2. Reverse URL Resolution**

Reversing a URL refers to retrieving the actual URL path using its name. This ensures that your app remains functional even if the URL structure changes.

* **Why Reverse URLs?**
  * Decouples views/templates from hardcoded URL paths.
  * Reduces errors caused by changes in URL patterns.

```python
from django.urls import reverse

reverse(app_name:url_name)
```

### Defining named and reverse URL's

Now, if you and look at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/old_url`, you will be redirected to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/new_url`. It is same as the redirect part we have seen before, but better than that.

* So, if you have to change the URL in future, you don't have to do it at all the places in the project. You just have to change it one place.

For example, here I have changed `old_url` to `x_url`, but I can still redirect to the same webpage.

When I visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/x_url`, it still redirects to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/new_url`.

#### Advantages of Using Named and Reversed URLs

* **Maintainability**: Centralized URL management reduces bugs and redundant updates.
* **Flexibility**: Easy to refactor or restructure your URLs.
* **Readability**: Makes both templates and views cleaner and more intuitive.
